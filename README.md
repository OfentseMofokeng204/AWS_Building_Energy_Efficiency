# AWS_Building_Energy_Efficiency
# 🏢 Building Energy Efficiency Prediction

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning model used to predict the **energy efficiency** of buildings based on features like wall area, roof area, orientation, and glazing area. The goal is to showcase the application of **supervised learning** using a `RandomForestRegressor` on a synthetic dataset.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Type**: Supervised Learning (Regression)
- **Algorithm Used**: Random Forest Regressor
- **Goal**: Predict the Energy Efficiency of buildings
- **Data**: Synthetic dataset generated for educational purposes
